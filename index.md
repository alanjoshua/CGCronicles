<h2>About me</h2>
 <p>Hi, I am Alan, a computer science undergraduate student at the University of Cincinnati, interested in the field of Computer Graphics. I decided to create this website as a means to journal my progress as I learn new topics in Computer Graphics.

<br>

I have been learning about 3D graphics on my own since around December 2019, and have been working on and off on implementing my own basic 3D rendering engine.Â 

<br>

I first started off with implementing a simple software(CPU) renderer, and then I moved on to OpenGL. Recently, I started learning and implementing Vulkan into my Kurama Engine, which I am also using as part of my research project with Dr. Jillian Aurisano.

<br>
The Research project involves investigating active stereo rendering using active shutter glasses and high refreshrate monitors.
